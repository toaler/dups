Being able to contribute on a project that has social impact would be amazing experience, let alone getting the opportunity to learn from great minds in the field of AI. In my freshman compsci class, I realized how technology can be used for social impact, when I wrote a infographic application that brings awareness of climate change. I would love to continue to leverage technology for the greater good of society.
